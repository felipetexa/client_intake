    subject: "Explanation of Legal Terms",
    body: `Good morning, Maryann.\n\nI received two emails from Gerry this morning.\n\nThe first said:\n\nRichard\nHave reviewed Ennio’s notes which are virtually incomprehensible\n\nMy review of the law to date is that if Ms Karek signed will and there was no obvious typo. If ennio not willing to admit his notes called for him to add the words “per stirpes” and somehow they weren’t included due to error ,we may not be able to challenge the will with any likelihood of success\nStill finishing up caselaw review.\nSuing Ennio a different story.\nHe put his insurer on notice for good reason\nMy clients nieces presumed they would get there dads share.Clients brother,cousin and nieces support my clients position\n\nTrying to put together another affidavit or 2  but suspect you wont see them until Tuesday\nAs I am in court most of today\nWill need more than  1 affidavit\n\nI don’t see limitation period as an issue as nieces not aware of will contents until very recently\nAfter passing of their grandmother\ng\n\nThe second said:\n\nWill reach out to Mr Fawcett\nWill check your belief re standing of potential beneficiaries\n\nWhat do these mean for us? Nothing, they are just Gerry’s rambling thoughts, trying to keep me informed of where he’s at. It’s a courtesy from him, really.\n\nWe don’t need to do anything, but I want to explain what Gerry is saying when he uses the phrase “per stirpes”. Unfortunately he is using it incorrectly, and it doesn’t apply here, but I’ll explain it anyway.\n\nWhen a person passes property down to others in her will, she has two options when leaving something to a GROUP of people.\n\nShe can leave it to that GROUP “per capita” or “per stirpes”.\n\nTake the scenario where the testator has three children, each of which has three children:\n\nChild 1 – Grandchild A, Grandchild B, Grandchild C\nChild 2 – Grandchild D, Grandchild E, Grandchild F\nChild 3 – Grandchild G, Grandchild H, Grandchild I\n\nIf I leave my estate to my 3 children in equal shares per capita, they each get 33.33%, and the grandchildren get nothing. If Child 1 dies before me, her share is split between Child 2 and Child 3, so that they each get 50%, and Grandchildren A, B and C get nothing.\n\nIf I leave my estate to my 3 children in equal shares per stirpes, they each get 33.33%, and the grandchildren get nothing. However, with a per stirpes gift, if Child 1 dies before me, her children split her share. Child 2 and Child 3 still get 33.33%, and Grandchildren A, B and C each get 11.11%.\n\n“Per stirpes” essentially keeps a gift within a single, vertical line of a family, whereas per capita makes a horizontal gift shared only among the group.\n\nOne reason it doesn’t apply here is that the gift of the house to Richard did not happen in Emily’s Will. It was done through joint tenancy, specifically NOT to be included in the Will. Another reason it doesn’t apply is that there is no gift to Richard in the Will at all, and a third reason is that there is no gift to a group. It is not possible to make a gift to a single person “per stirpes”.\n\nDoes all of that make sense to you?\n\nI will keep you posted.\n\nRichard`

    subject: "Estate Challenge",
    body: `Hi, Maryann.\n\nWhat I said to Gerry, essentially, is this:\n\nIf Chester isn’t asking the Court to change the Will (he isn’t), and if he isn’t asking the Court to pause the administration of the Estate while any issues with the Will get sorted out (he isn’t doing that, either), then he has no reason not to do what the Will tells him to do, which is to transfer the money and the house which was formerly owned by Richard and Emily, to you.\n\nMy view of the case is the same as it was.\n\nIf Paige and Brooke intend to challenge the Will, they need to do something. They haven’t. When I wrote to Dennis I spelled out for him why any challenge to the Will would probably fail, and I suspect that he did his own research and has come to the same conclusion that I came to, which is that there is nothing confusing or unclear in the Will, it just doesn’t say what Paige and Brooke (and Chester) think that it SHOULD say. The Court’s job is not to try and speculate what someone might have wanted to do and to rewrite a perfectly understandable document to make it say something completely different than it currently says. That would be a horrifying interference in someone’s estate planning which I don’t think the Court would ever do.\n\nIf there is a problem here, and if the Will doesn’t accurately set out what Emily wanted to happen, the fault lies with Ennio for doing such a poor job in helping Emily with her Estate. I had this discussion with William, the lawyer who is going to be defending Ennio if he gets sued – it was immediately obvious to me that the plan which Ennio set up had a serious flaw in it, which is that if you, Chester or Richard died before Emily, then her plans would not be carried out. It was a bad idea to put the homes in joint tenancy with the children. There was no benefit to doing that, and it created a huge risk, which is why we are where we are now.\n\nEven if Paige and Brooke decide to sue Ennio, it won’t affect the Will. It is theoretically possible that Ennio could humbly admit that he screwed up, and explain to the Court that what his client Emily wanted is not what is happening, and the reason that you are getting two houses is that he was negligent. From what I know about Ennio, he won’t do that. LawPRO also won’t want him to do that, because it’s an admission of negligence which means that LawPRO would probably have to pay Paige and Brooke the value of the house.\n\nGerry emailed me this morning to say that Chester “might file something else” but I haven’t seen anything yet and I don’t think that anything he could file would change anything at all.\n\nRichard`

    subject: "Neighbour Dispute",
    body: `Good morning, Mike and Sara.\n\nPlease see the attached application received from Hummingbird Law, the lawyers for your neighbours.\n\nThey have decided to start the ball rolling, which is fine. Either way, the matter is now coming before the Court.\n\nThe June 26th date is just a placeholder – if we’re ready to proceed by then, we can, but if we need more time, we can adjourn.\n\nPlease read this over and give me your thoughts.\n\nThey are looking for a declaration that this right of way does not include vehicular access, based on the size and location of the ROW, and the impossibility of driving a car within it without trespassing on the Albion / Coxe property, or the property across Laneway 200.\n\nI assess the claim for $50,000 as being groundless, and an attempt to intimidate you. That doesn’t mean that there is ZERO chance of an award of damages, but I assess the risk as very low.\n\nThe issue here is going to be that there are no restrictions imposed on the right of way, and they are trying to get the Court to declare that vehicle use is not permitted.\n\nIn your favour is the fact that the City won’t allow a driveway, and that means that your property is worth vastly less if there is no vehicle access and no parking.\n\nIn your favour is the fact that the original language is not restrictive – it does not limit the uses which you can make of the ROW.\n\nIn your favour is the fact that you purchased your property with the expectation of being able to access it by car, and that you relied on that in paying the price that you did.\n\nIn your favour is that fact that they didn’t complain about the ROW being used for cars for the first several years.\n\nNOT in your favour is that you have been going outside the ROW. Are you still doing that, or has that problem been solved with a smaller vehicle?\n\nNOT in your favour is that you don’t have the right to go outside of the ROW at all. If you can’t use the ROW without going onto their property, then that’s a serious problem.\n\nIf you can now use the ROW to get in, without going onto their property, then we need to document that.\n\nIt isn’t up to them to complain that you are trespassing on the property on the other side of the laneway – will that owner give us a letter saying that they don’t mind?\n\nPlease review, and let’s chat on Thursday morning – what works for you, from 7:00 on?\n\nRichard`

    subject: "Motion Risk Assessment",
    body: `Good morning, Nick.\n\nThanks for dropping off that motion material on Friday. It’s dated July 2021. Is this the same motion, finally coming on for a hearing five years later??\n\nI have looked it over.\n\nI’m sorry to say that I don’t think that your action will survive this motion, and I think that Ms. Woods will get summary judgment. You will be ordered to pay legal fees, probably in the $10,000 plus range.\n\nThe critical facts are:\n\n1. On April 30, 2019, Justice Sloan ordered that the four properties forming part of your mother’s Estate be transferred to Chapman, as Estate trustee for your aunt Sabina. Effective April 30, 2019, those properties became assets of your aunt’s Estate.\n2. This decision was informed in large part but the fact that your mother declared that she held the properties in trust for Sabina, in 1992.\n3. The claim which you have started, and in which this motion for summary judgment is bring brought, has your mother’s Estate as plaintiff – not you personally. You are described as plaintiff “in [you] capacity as Estate trustee of the Estate of Monika Andrea Stingelin, deceased”.\n4. Your mother’s Estate was the defendant in the action in which Justice Sloan made his order transferring the four properties from your mother’s Estate to your aunt’s.\n5. In the current action, you allege that Woods owed your mother a duty of care.\n6. You allege that Woods, in a meeting in December 2015, assured you (although “you” are not a plaintiff) that the four properties were, and would remain in a Hensen trust which would benefits Sabina so long as she lived, and her disabled son Tony thereafter.\n7. You allege that Woods repeated this in March of 2016.\n8. When Sabina died, her Estate trustee Penny, and Penny’s lawyer sought to have you transfer the four properties to Sabina’s Estate.\n9. You refused, and the result was the order of Justice Sloan.\n10. Justice Sloan’s order can not now be changed. As a matter of law, the properties belong to Sabina’s Estate.\n11. You allege that Woods’ advice to you in December 2015 and March 2016 was negligent, and that you lost the benefit of being a contingent beneficiary of your mother’s Estate.\n12. It’s important to remember what hat you’re wearing in this action – you are representing your mother’s Estate. You are not a plaintiff in your personal capacity.\n13. You are claiming four heads of damage:\n   a. The financial costs of the application by Sabina which lead to Justice Sloan’s order\n   b. The potential loss of being a contingent beneficiary of your mother’s Estate\n   c. The reputational harm of having been found to be in breach of your duty as a fiduciary; and\n   d. The reputational harm and mental suffering arising from your mother’s Estate being declared similarly in breach of duty\n\nNick, there is a lot of transference of claims which are perhaps better expressed as personal claims and those which are the claims of your mother’s Estate. The personal claims, those which might be characterized as complaints of Nicke Singelin, the individual, have no business being in here, because you are plaintiff solely in your capacity as trustee of your mother’s Estate.\n\nWhen I look at it through that lens, I conclude that the damages claimed under (b), (c) and (d) above are not available, even if there were a duty of care from Woods to you (or your mother’s Estate), and even if that duty had been breached.\n\nYou as an individual and you as the legal representative of your mother’s Estate are not interchangeable. Your mother’s Estate has a separate identity in law. Notionally, it could have its own claims, quite separate from your personal ones.\n\nBecause you did not list yourself as a plaintiff personally, claims which are personal to you ((b) and (c)) can not be awarded. It’s as if I had sued the City for damaging my neighbour’s car with a snow plow. The car might have been damaged, and it might have been the City’s fault, but it isn’t my claim to bring.\n\nHead (d) of damages is simply not available in law. A non-human legal entity can not be awarded damages for mental suffering, nor for reputational harm. Perhaps in some circumstances there might be a claim for reputational harm but I would have trouble articulating those circumstances, and I know that they don’t exist here.\n\nHead (a) of the damages is, conceptually, possible. The costs were awarded against your mother’s Estate, and the Estate is the plaintiff here. For that to pan out, you would need to establish that Woods advised you, as Estate trustee, that the Hensen trust was in effect and would stay that way, and that you should hold the properties in your mother’s Estate instead of transferring them to Sabina. That would create a lawyer-client relationship, and a duty of care. You would then have to show that Woods breached that duty of care in giving you the advice that she did, and that as a result of her advice, you took the position that you did, and ultimately lost the argument and were ordered to pay $22,000 in costs.\n\nI think that you’ve pleaded the essential elements of that, Nick. I haven’t seen Woods’ defence, and I take it that no discoveries have been conducted, and no affidavits of documents have been produced?\n\nI would be curious to know whether Woods admits that she gave that advice.\n\nLawPRO is tough to deal with, Nick. They fight hard, and getting the $22,000 will not be easy. You may not even have the evidence needed to win the case. Regardless, this should be a Small Claims Court matter, where as you know I am a deputy Judge, so I don’t appear there as a lawyer.\n\nI am not available to deal with this in court on June 6, Nick. It doesn’t sound like LawPRO wants to grant an adjournment, so that puts me in a bit of a bind.\n\nI don’t know who else locally does cases against other lawyers.\n\nMy strategy though would be to adjourn the motion and have a frank call with LawPRO and try to resolve this for some portion of the $22,000 in costs, although I don’t know how strong the argument would be because I haven’t seen the evidence.\n\nBottom line for me is that I can’t do a June 6th motion, though.\n\nRichard`

    subject: "Accident Intake Summary",
    body: `Thank you for speaking with me on February 27th about the motor vehicle accident you were involved in on December 1, 2023. I understand that on that date you were driving your vehicle on McMurray Street when a pickup truck owned by Melloul-Blamey Construction proceeded from a stop at a stop sign directly into the side of your vehicle. You are very fortunate to have dash cam footage of what happened, and I assess that liability in this situation will not be an issue. It was clearly the fault of the driver of the pickup truck. I understand that your vehicle was spun around 180 degrees and pushed into a hydro pole before coming to a stop on the road. You have obtained a partial police report indicating that the driver of the vehicle was Scott Flannery and that your husband, Chandana Sembakutti, was in the vehicle with you and also observed what happened.\n\nYou are uncertain whether any charges were laid against the other driver, but it seems likely that they were.\n\nYou report that as a result of this accident you suffered whiplash, neck pain, shoulder pain, upper and lower back pain, headaches, tingling and numbness in your right arm and pain and numbness in your left leg. You went to St. Mary’s Hospital on the day of the accident, and in the emergency room x-rays were carried out and you were referred back to your family doctor with concussion symptoms, soft tissue injuries and some vertigo. Soft tissue injuries were diagnosed in your neck and shoulder at the emergency room.\n\nYou were working at the time of the accident at Teledyne DALSA as a production associate and although you were off work for an extended period of time you did return in March of 2024 on modified duties. You were able to work, with difficulty initially, but shortly after you resumed work you had to go off again until November of last year. You have been able to return to some duties, but in a modified role and at the end of the day you are in significant pain. You are receiving physiotherapy, massage therapy, chiropractic care (this is not ongoing), osteopathy and you do attend at a pain clinic. Your family doctor is Dr. Waseema Rehman and you have attended regularly with him. You may also be receiving some treatment through your work benefits (or your husband’s benefits). You tell us that you were involved in a prior accident`
